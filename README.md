# DisPy

python wrapper for discord api designed for use with a discord bot  
using python version 3.9.5 for development

## What is it?

---
PyCord is inspired by [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py), which I have used previously to create discord bots in python. I have never really understood APIs or how they are used, so I decided to try and create my own discord API wrapper in Python. This project will also help me refine my Python skills, as well as learn about APIs and asyncronous programming in Python.
